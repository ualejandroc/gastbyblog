Yes, there is an ugly side of blogging that nobody talks about because it DOES NOT SELL !. There is a side that those articles have not told you where they talk about the beauty of having a blog, an online business, so that you live traveling while working on what you love, all while generating passive income. There is an ugly side of blogging that the “gurus” that sell you mentors don't tell you…

In this article, I tell you the truth, without any hesitation, although I love having a blog and an online business; There is an ugly and hard side of blogging that should tell you ...
Keep reading, because if you think about starting a blog or that you already have it this is something you should know ...

Your family and friends will think you went crazy.
You work alone.
You are your own boss.

The imposter's syndrome will require you to attack
There will be a thousand things to learn.
You will have to overcome your fears or set aside your project.
Others think that you do NOTHING and sometimes you will feel the same.
Your family and friends will think you went crazy.

I promise you, they will think you went crazy and you will have to arm yourself with courage to continue behind your dreams even though the people around (even those who love you well), ask you to leave the madness.
They will think you went crazy, it happened to me and it still happens to me. Many people; acquaintances, friends, family I think I'm crazy and although now my blog has become an online school with more than 300 students and a business that offers multiple services; People keep asking me when I'm going to find a job!
My advice? Be cautious with whom you share your dreams. You don't need to tell everyone what your plan is.
Take company and inspiration in podcasts where they interview people who have already achieved what you hope to do.
Another tip, notice the firm intention that any comment will slip you.

You work alone.
Working alone every day is hard, no matter if you are introverted or extroverted. Motivating yourself to sit in front of your computer to write and create almost without having social contact is difficult. Believe me that after a few months, no matter how hermit you are, it will affect you.

You are your own boss.
Being your own boss sounds good? Well, think twice, because being a boss is not an easy task, much less if you are your own boss.
I have led many work teams, but being my own boss has been a harder task than supervising others.

Personally I am a super strict boss, I push myself a lot and I have had to learn to be more benevolent with myself.
However, many entrepreneurs have another problem and they don't know how to organize themselves. This results in the passing of time and no results.
My advice; set your goals and make a quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily action plan to meet your goals. Then, celebrate your achievements, be grateful for what you have built and the opportunities that have been given. It will help you maintain the motivation you need to move forward.


Monetization takes time to arrive.
That a blog gets positioned takes months and years. I'm not exaggerating!
Look, unlike 95% of blogs, my blog began to receive thousands of visits within 3 weeks of launch ( here I tell you how I did it ). Even so, I launched it at the end of January; it was only in August that I transformed it into a business and only from October on I began to monetize. We are in November and I have not yet managed to generate income that matches those of the management position I had before starting this business.

You may think that I am a slow one and you might be right. However, I want to prepare you because there are many people there who will try to sell you the idea that everything can be taken out in 6 months and I honestly don't think you should have those expectations.
Blogs that make money (as if to stay) are well made and have almost all these characteristics that are impossible to have in just 6 months:

• A good business idea
• At least 40 posts of good quality
• They have one or more “lead magnets”
• A good website; graphic design, payment systems, subscription systems
• They have complied with legal requirements and procedures that can take a long time to be ready
• They have an accounting system
• They have several sources of income; physical products, info-products, sponsors, etc.

It is really very difficult for all this to be in 6 months.

The imposter's syndrome will require you to attack
The impostor's symptom is a feeling that you are a fraud and affects the vast majority of people. Great personalities like Sheryl Sandberg (the second in command of Facebook) have declared themselves victims of the blessed impostor syndrome.
In his book "Lean In" Sheryl narrates how it is always thought that someone will discover at some point that she is not valuable enough and that she does not deserve to be in the place she has arrived.
As a blogger you will feel that insecurity multiplied by a thousand. This is due to the simple fact that everything you publish has the potential to reach thousands of people. (Well, it has the potential to reach thousands of people if you have learned my techniques to gain traffic with Pinterest, but it will be sincerely difficult for them to read you. #Honesty) If you want to learn more about how to generate traffic with Pinterest this is the link To my free webinar.

To counteract the impostor syndrome, I advise you to always be genuine. Be well documented before speaking, be honest, be yourself.
Another recommendation is that you make a list of your successes and strengths. Have this list on hand and go to it when you feel bad.

There will be a thousand things to learn.
Not only will you have to be an expert in the subject you are going to talk about. You will have to learn about business, copywriting, marketing, sales, sales funnels, social networks, handling of many platforms, design, etc, etc, etc.
Here the only advice I can give you is to take the bull by the horns and start learning. There are no short cuts! Learning will help you in your business and will fight the impostor syndrome.


Personally I learn a lot from Podcasts (from my niche) and then I use the nights when I no longer have the brain to work, to take courses, to update myself and to learn more.
You manage everything and everything. At first you will not have money to hire many people, so you will have to do everything. Blog posts, social networks, products, customer service, sales, page maintenance, accounting, etc, etc, etc.
My advice here is to prepare yourself because your blog is going to grow and become a business! Go visualizing the day you are going to hire people to help you. Think of possible people who can help you in the future and the activities you could delegate. Lean on technology, there are many platforms that will make your life easier.

You will have to overcome your fears or set aside your project.
Sorry to bring you the bad news. Yes, you are going to have to leave the fear of the camera, the networks, the technology. From now on I tell you that you are going to have to convince yourself that you can with everything and when the time comes to launch and do it!
It is to overcome fears or leave your project. This business belongs to champions.

Others think that you do NOTHING and sometimes you will feel the same.
Have you seen how much work goes into monetizing a blog? It is so much! Even so, there will be those who refer to your business as a "hobby."
To make matters worse you will feel that you do nothing because, as I said before, the one that monetizes takes time!
My advice is not to listen to them, you know what you're worth and what you do, follow your dream!

And you see, not everything is rosy, people working from the beach or from a cafe. However, it has its great rewards. If you want a post (totally honest) of the rewards put me a comment below.
