## Tip to write the perfect post # 1: 
Decide the purpose of your article
What is the purpose of the post? There are two types of articles; those who entertain and those who solve a problem. Think about what category your article will be in and make sure that what you have written meets its objective.

If you are going to solve a problem, however small, make sure that the information you provide is sufficient to meet this goal. Do not leave your reader halfway!

## Tip to write the perfect post # 2: Plan
There are those who have their blog as a hobby and have no interest in seeing it grow. But, on the contrary, you are interested in growing your blog and generating income, planning is key!

Schedule your articles
 

I recommend that you keep planning your articles based on the times of the year, your business interests and your time. For example, if you are your blog it is about food; Plan Halloween recipes for publication in October. If you are a fashion blogger, plan articles on how to pack for summer vacations.

Planning your content will make you produce more interesting articles in less time!


The topic of planning is so important that in this article I give you a step-by-step guide with everything you need to know to plan the content of your blog so that it generates more traffic, more revenue and saves you time.

##  Tip to write the perfect post # 3:  Write an attractive title for readers and search engines
The title is the most important marketing tool for your article. You can share everything you want on social networks, that if it does not have a title that attracts and is designed for search engines you will not achieve readers.

Optimize your title for search engines (like Google)
SEO optimization is a very extensive topic, but here are some basic tips for you to optimize your title:

First, think about what words or phrases your potential readers can use to find your article and include these phrases. For example; My article "How to make money from home with a blog" is intended for those who are going to look for "Make money", "Make money from home", "Make money with a blog"

Now, if you need ideas on how to search for ideas on topics that people look for, I suggest you use the Google word search (Google adwords). Another idea is to put a keyword on Pinterest and see what topics appear to you.
 

- How do you write an attractive title?
For a title to be attractive you must give the reader a good reason to read the article. Here are some formulas for writing titles that conquer:

## Tip to write the perfect post # 4:  Write a good introduction
The title is what makes people go to your article, but the introduction is what makes them decide to read it so it must be attractive. In addition, search engines will look in the introduction by keywords to decide whether or not to show your article in the search results.

 

## Tip to write the perfect post # 5:  Create a base structure for your article
I recommend that you make a list of the topics that you are going to deal with in your article and that you take them as a basis for dividing your article into paragraphs with titles. Most people just "scan" articles quickly so make sure the paragraphs are short and the title of each paragraph is attractive.

## Tip to write the perfect post # 6:  Put links to your other articles
Putting links to other articles on your blog has several advantages:

People will stay longer in your blog
You will position yourself better in search engines (because search engines value sites that have this interlinking)
You give your reader more information
Tip to write the perfect post # 7:  End with a phrase that motivates participation
If you want to generate dialogue with your readers and that they eventually feel part of your community, I suggest you finish your post with a short summary of the topic, trying and inviting your readers to give their opinion.

I give you an examples:

“… These are my tips for traveling with children. I would love to hear from you, tell me, have you traveled with children? How did it go? Do you have other tips?

## Tip to write the perfect post # 8:  Attach images strategically
Remember that your blog is a brand, use images and designs that go with your brand. This means that you always use the same colors, typography and style.

Another very important point is that you should save your images with a name that matches the search words you have planted for your article. For example, instead of leaving the file with the name "12490adm.jpg" you put the name "easy recipes for Easter."

The search engines also categorize the images, so putting a relevant name to the images will help you to position yourself in search engines.

## Tip to write the perfect post # 9:  Be sure to populate your “alt text”
The “alt text” will be the description that goes to Pinterest when someone makes a “pin” of your images. As Pinterest is a search engine it is essential that the description contains the keywords for which you want your audience to find you.

Do you want to write posts that many people read, comment and share?  Well, luckily there is a formula to make sure your posts are a success, here I share it.

Tip for writing the perfect post # 9:  Consider having an incentive to subscribe for each post
I have seen many blogs that still use the "subscribe to our newsletter to receive our weekly / daily news" technique. I have never really subscribed to a newsletter using this method and I think that the people who do it will be told.

What has made me subscribe to a newsletter is the interest of receiving something in return. To get people to subscribe to your blog you must give them something that is useful as an incentive.

For example, Bren from drendid.com has a blog with recipes and craft projects. It has a library of free resources where you have you will find patterns for crafts and printable sheets with activities for birthdays, Christmas, etc. As you can see, they are not super elaborate things, but they do provide a benefit when you subscribe.

The Brendid page offers free printables (recipes, worksheets) for those who subscribe
Wifeteachermommy.com is a website made by a teacher / blogger with resources for teachers such as printable activity sheets, planners, bookmarks, in short material that facilitates the lives of teachers! It's great, who doesn't like to make life easier?

Read this article where I give you a free way to give incentives to your readers.

## Tip to write the perfect post # 10:  Promote your Post!
Making a quality post takes time and effort and the greatest reward is that it is read, commented and shared. To achieve this you must promote it. Here I give you some guidelines to do it:

- Make a Pin

After publishing your post, make a Pin for Pinterest. Pinterest is a platform that generates a lot of traffic, so I recommend that you take a minute and pin your post. Wait a month or two and "pine" again your article.

If you want to know more about Pinterest and how to do it to help you grow your traffic exponentially, read this.

- Share it on the networks

Share your article on Facebook, Instagram (you can use the same images you use for Pinterest), Twitter, etc.

I know that sharing on Social Media consumes a lot of time, for this reason I suggest you use the free hootie service to program what you share on the networks.
