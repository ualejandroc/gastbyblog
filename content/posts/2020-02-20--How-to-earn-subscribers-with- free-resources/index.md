But first ... Why do you need subscribers?
Having subscribers is one of the "assets" that should be most coveted by bloggers or business owners. Subscribers are potential customers who have given you permission to send information directly to their email.

I think that if you are in the world of blogging, you will have already realized that for your blog to be a business that gives you income you can live on, you will need to have a list of subscribers.

I have seen many blogs that still use the "subscribe to our newsletter to receive our weekly / daily news" technique. I have never really subscribed to a newsletter using this method and I think that the people who do it will be told.

What has made me subscribe to a newsletter is the interest of receiving something in return. To get people to subscribe to your blog you must give them something that is useful as an incentive. Here I show you how to win subscribers for your blog.

For example, if you subscribe to my list you will have access to a fantastic library of free resources that will help you as a blogger and / or as a digital entrepreneur.

A free library works as follows. I have created a lot of help material for bloggers and entrepreneurs that is available in the ‚Äúfree resources‚Äù section of my blog. To access this page you must write a password that will arrive in an email, once you have confirmed your subscription.

Now, by legal provisions, the subscriber must confirm their subscription before they can receive the password. This confirmation is to prevent people from receiving spam.

Here is how the system works to win subscribers for your blog: 

 1. The user fills his data in the subscription button of the page:

2. Once you have confirmed the subscription you will receive your password:

 

This system is great for earning subscribers for your blog because it is completely free and very easy to set up!

Here I give you a step by step how to get people to subscribe to your newsletter:

Prepare a series of incentives for your subscribers. It can be something like an e-book, worksheets, "check lists". To give you some ideas here I leave some of the incentives that use several pages:
 

Bren from drendid.com is a blog with recipes and craft projects. It has a library of free resources where you have you will find patterns for crafts and printable sheets with activities for birthdays, Christmas, etc. As you can see, they are not super elaborate things, but they do give a benefit when you subscribe.


 

Wifeteachermommy.com is a website made by a teacher / blogger with resources for teachers such as printable activity sheets, planners, bookmarks, in short material that facilitates the lives of teachers! It's great, who doesn't like to make life easier?


Now, once you have at least 5 incentives for your resource library, you can proceed to the step. Well, the truth is that you could start the library when you have much less resources, but you want your subscribers to have something of value and it is not found With an empty bookstore. Ideally, you should have an incentive for every article you post on your blog, but this is not always feasible. Anyway, you can and should mention your bookstore in every article you take out.

Prepare an image for each incentive since we will need to insert images in our library. I use Canva (Canva.com) to create my images. Canva is a resource that allows you to create graphics and gives you access to images. It is super useful!


3. Now you have to create a section in your menu for your library of free resources. I will tell you how it is done on wordpress.org and I imagine that you will know how to do it on the platform you use. So, this is how it works on wordpress.org:
- create a new page, for this you go to ‚Äúpages‚Äù add new


- You give your page a name and press ‚Äúpublish‚Äù. I recommend that you put the name "free resources" that is much more striking than "bookstore" or something.


- Once you have created your page you will add it to your menu because you want it to be very visible. For this you go to "Appeareance" and then "Menu"


- The page you created, "free resources" will appear in the list of pages, select it and press "move to menu"


Please do not forget to press "know menu" to save the changes.

- Now you are going to protect your page with a password. For this you go to the right side of your page, click on ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù, ‚Äúpassword protected‚Äù and choose a password.


An advice! If you have read my article on how to start a blog , you will have seen that I recommend writing down your blog passwords in a notebook that is safe. I suggest you write down because you are going to discover that you will need to open accounts in many services (the majority that I am going to recommend you will be free;)) and it will be difficult to remember all the passwords.

- Now go to your Free Resources page, press ‚Äúadd media‚Äù and insert the images you created for each incentive. Adjust the size if necessary.


- Now, what we are going to do is that when people click on the image they go directly to the incentive sheet and this is how we achieve this:

- Go to your Dropbox account and save all your incentives there. Remember that at the beginning of this article I said you would need Dropbox.

If you do not know, Dropbox is a system that gives you the ability to save large numbers of files in a "cloud", this means that your incentives will have a URL.

- Once you are in Dropbox, select an incentive and copy its URL, for example


- To link the image of your incentive with the file in Dropbox, click on the image, then click on the link icon (1 in the circle) and then paste the address of the file you copied from Dropbox. Press save when ready.

Do not worry, this does not give access to your Dropbox account, you can only see the shared document :).


This is how it will look when you have all items saved üôÇ


But how do you get your password to access the free resources page?
 

Well, here is the step by step process as I do it with mailchimp, but you can adapt it to your newsletter provider.

 

Once you have logged into your account, you go to "Lists" and then "Create List"

2. Fill in the list data with the information you choose

3. You go to ‚Äúsign up forms‚Äù and then ‚Äúembedded forms‚Äù

4. Fill out the form with the information you want it to go and then copy the code that mailchimp provides you.

This code is inserted in your page in the place where you want it to go. There are so many ways and places to insert the code that I can't describe all of them here. I think one of the easiest is to insert the form with a Widget. If you don't know how to insert the code into your page, you should look for a tutorial to do it.

5. Once the ad to request the subscription is on the page, you should be able to send your readers the code.

6. Go back to ‚ÄúSign a Forms‚Äù and then choose ‚ÄúForm Builder‚Äù

7. Within Form Builder you go to ‚ÄúConfirmation, thank you page‚Äù. This is the message that reaches your readers to confirm their subscription and it is here that you can provide the access code to the library of free resources.
