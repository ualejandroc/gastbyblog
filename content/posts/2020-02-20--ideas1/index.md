There are times when in order to pay off our debts, buy something for ourselves or our children, reach our financial goals or simply diversify our income, it is important to know how to earn money fast.
Because being honest: Who doesn't like to have extra money?
And better yet: fast.




## 1. Garage Sale

Who doesn't have items that he doesn't use in his house? Doing the spring cleaning (or at the station you are) and selling what you no longer occupy is a way to earn quick money.
You can notify your neighbors by putting cards, sending them a message by whatsapp or to the group of neighbors (yes, finally the group of neighbors serves you for something apart, obviously, from the good morning with Tweety).

## 2. Sell products
We always have products that, as they have worked for us, we want to recommend but, why not make quick money at the same time? - You can become a distributor and start selling them among your acquaintances, friends, neighbors and family.



## 3. Give classes

Are you good at math, dancing or painting? Dare to offer yourself as a teacher with your acquaintances and neighbors. Advertise and according to the amount of interested you can make groups or individualize it.

Also if you know Pilates, yoga, HIIT or any exercise, you can start teaching at your home, park or nearby gym. Cheer up!

## 4. Invest in real estate
Ok, this is not so fast, but it helps you generate a stable cash flow while you want to rent it or a profit in case you choose to buy and sell. There is also the option of investing little money in real estate projects on the Internet in exchange for good interests in the medium term.

## 5. Child and elderly care


If you have the ability and taste to care for children or adults, it can be a very good option to offer you acquaintances or neighbors to take care of your children or "grandparents." You decide your rate and your schedules, for adults the normal thing is that it is required in the day and for children in the night.
Of course, it is very important that you win the trust of parents or guardians, it is not easy to leave someone with a stranger.

## 6. Rent a room


Do you have a room (or a house) that you don't inhabit? You can rent it by month or by day / week and earn quick money.
If you decide by month, I recommend using the most famous real estate rental pages in your city, but if you are more interested by day or week, I recommend Airbnb .

## 7. Arrange clothes
If you know how to sew, make hems and basic sewing skills, you can offer your services for small arrangements in clothing.

If you know a little more, you could even offer to make costumes for children's events, yes, consider that they are usually in a hurry on those dates.

## 8. Pastry

Do you like to make sweets, cakes, cookies, muffins, etc.? Why not offer your services for this?
Of course, what they complain about most is that customers always haggle, so I recommend that you do not wear out, define your prices well and do not worry if customers “leave you”, it is not worth spending money, effort and sacrifice family time for a job not well paid.
Better to sell little, at a good price and earn quick money.

## 9. Professional services
Are you a professional or technician in something and do you have a full time job? For example, you might be an accountant, writer, graphic designer, teacher, industrial engineer, chef, saleswoman, computer / cell phone repair, HR, interior designer or whatever. Sell ​​your services to someone else and earn money fast.

Your clients could be:
    • People who do not want / know how to do what you do
    • Companies that are starting and do not have the money or the infrastructure to hire more
    • Small and medium businesses that need little service

## 10. Caring for animals

You love animals? You could go from taking them out for a walk, to taking care of them for their owners' vacations, it all depends on the space you have available. Nor do you limit yourself only to dogs or cats, there are a lot of pets that need love from you.

## 11. Buy-sell
If you are aware of any product: cell phones, furniture, clothing and designer bags, even cars or houses, you could buy items in good condition at a reduced price and after repairing and cleaning them, you can resell them at a good price.

## 12. Cleaning
Do not think only of the home, cleaning is required for everything:
    • Cars
    • Houses / apartments in depth
    • Premises / common areas
    • Furniture
    • Carpets
    • Polish floors
    • Cleaning at heights
You can start with little investment and then scale your business, with more

## 13. Catering
If you are good for decoration and food, I recommend catering in small parties. This can go from:
    • Banquets for small parties or special events
    • Dessert table, sweets
    • Wine bar, cocktails, cheeses, pizzas, strawberries with cream, etc.
Your imagination (and that of your customers) is the limit.

## 14. Music

If you know how to mix music well and you have a good team, you can rent to put the music in small parties.
You could even buy rockoles and rent them or rent the equipment to make your own karaoke at home.

## 15. Waitress
If you like customer service and are not afraid to do a little physical work, you could work as a waitress at events or restaurants.

## 16. Driver

If you have car and free time, you can earn quick money by taking people to their destination. The most famous of the platforms is Uber, but yes, check how much you would have to invest, since the account does not always come out so you could start on your own and go on making your reputation and customers.
It is also valid to make home delivery of a business or sign up for UberEats.

## 17. Sell / rent real estate
Without investing any money (although if you need a little education, some agencies provide free education) you can be a real estate agent, find clients, sell or rent real estate and caching! (Will the sound come from "cash in" in English? Mmmhhh, maybe I need sleep ...)

## 18. Housekeeper

If your neighbors frequently go on vacation or someone has a vacation home where you live, you can charge to take care of it and maybe even manage it in matters of gardening, grooming, etc.
It can be a good option for, if the owners want to rent the property, you can take care that it is in good condition and hand over the keys and obviously take a percentage.

## 19. Washing clothes
From your home you can offer laundry and ironing services to your neighbors or close acquaintances. You will need a scale and many clothes cleaning liquids.

## 20. Recycling

Some people throw away a lot of materials that can be recycled. If you want to help the environment and also earn some money you can offer your services to collect that material and then sell it to recycling companies.
Another option is to sell these products to people who need it for crafts (such as toilet paper rolls). Then you could scale your business to companies.

## 21. Home Maintenance
If you are good at plumbing, appliance repair, waterproofing or painting, please! Offer your services. The moms who work from home would love to receive women to perform these tasks.
Note: An application for these jobs among women is about to be launched in Argentina, it is called Femplea . I hope she arrives in Mexico soon (or someone throws her here (you can be that someone! (Do you really notice that I like math?))).

## 22. Event Organizer

If you like to organize, have good taste and make good deals with good suppliers, you can start offering your services in small events and then continue to larger events.

## 23. Travel
Here are two options: You can be a tourist guide in your own city, in many cities there are walking or cycling tours that could be an excellent option for you.
To take advantage of your taste for the trip, you can start a travel agency. You can start with small trips, within your state or city and expand to other countries and continents. Bonus: you travel for free!

## 24. Translation

If you know another language, you can offer your translation and interpretation services. I worked in a Japanese company and saw firsthand the great need for good interpreters and how well paid they are.
Although you do not want or can work in a company, there are many people from other countries living in Mexico who would be very interested in having you go with them to buy at the supermarket, I tell you because it happened to me, imagine buying jocoque cream instead of cream like the one we use in Mexico :(.

## 25. Party services
Lately I have seen a super boom in theme parties and this can be used to earn quick money like this:
    • Making kits for Spa parties
    • Kits for pajamas with their teepee or tipi (Indian style huts)
    • Rental of inflatables, tables and chairs
    • Invitations
    • Decoration income
    • Kits of "cochinadas": water balloons, paint, colored powders, booger mucus, etc.
I already gave you an idea, your clients and you can come up with more and it can be a great way to make money fast and have fun.

## 26. Services for special dates

Every time a special date comes, gifts, decorations, food, etc., always go everywhere on the subject; You can take advantage of this moment to make your “Augustine” and earn quick money:
    • New Year's Eve, Christmas, September 15, etc.
    • Surprise breakfasts
    • Flower arrangements
    • Romantic getaways / romantic dinners
    • Custom gifts
    • Kits to watch movies
    • Small gifts for school or workmates
    • Hand-painted blankets
There are a thousand things to sell for those dates and you can surely find one that you love.

## 27. Garden care
If you like gardening you can offer to cut, fertilize and care for the gardens of nearby people.
You can even scale your business and offer your services to party halls, gardens, shopping centers, etc.
There are many events for those who ask for rent of plants for decoration too.

## 28. Crafts

If you like to knit, embroider, paint, make jewelry, soaps, creams, work with wood, make rag dolls ... whatever, you can do it and sell it through fairs, with neighbors and acquaintances, etc. You can also sell them through Facebook Marketplace and  Etsy so you can earn money fast.

## 29. Sell your hair
Well, this is an option that can only be done once every 2-3 years, but it could help you earn quick money and get out of trouble. Find out about the quality and price of hair in the market, so you know who to go to and how much to sell.

## 30. Rent things

This weekend I was telling my partner that why we didn't do more outdoor activities (since it's not cold anymore), such as going camping.
"But we don't have camping equipment," he told me.
How many times have you stopped doing things because you don't have the necessary equipment? Do you think only you have that problem?
If you have bicycles, camping equipment, skiing, a barbecue, ATV, kayaks ... even your wedding dress, party decoration, inflatable pools, grass clipper, drill, vacuum cleaner, everything. Advertise it and start earning fast money by renting those things that only take place in your home.

## 31. Sing
If you sing or play an instrument, you could offer your services to restaurants or bars on weekends. Remember that you have to bring your own sound system, microphone, chair and everything ready for your show.

## 32. Food

Sells food! It is the best option to earn fast and constant money. You can offer desserts, breakfasts (for those who work) meals on weekends, snacks, micheladas, food for Lent, tacos, hamburgers, food for special events, etc. the sky is the limit and we Mexicans love to eat! (Or just me?)
