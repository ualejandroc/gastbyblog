Attracting subscribers is an essential element of having a successful business. To attract subscribers, Lead Magnets fulfill an essential function for you to build a list of subscribers / sales prospects.

What is a leadmagnet?

A Lead Magnet is a ‚Äúgift‚Äù that you give to your prospects in exchange for their data (usually name and email address). Once they give you their data you have the possibility to contact the prospects to continue sending information about your business, promotions, invitations, etc.

Many people do not use Lead Magnets because they think it can be difficult to do them, but in reality, some can be created in a matter of 1 hour, as you will see in the examples below.

Why create a lead magnet? Because generally the sales process does not work like this: people see your product / service and buy it.

No, you usually have to work a little more on the sale and that is why it is good to become a prospect database.

There are 6 marketing mistakes made by almost all entrepreneurs and fortunately they are easy to fix once they have been identified.  Keep reading, I'm sure you're making one or more of these mistakes.

Attract subscribers; Lead Magnets ideas:
Capture subscribers with a Webinar / Masterclass: This is a lead magnet in which you give them a small class and end up with a sales pitch. You can do it with a prerecorded Webinar or it can be live. You can use platforms like easywebinar or webinarjam whose prices vary between 450-800 usd annually and you have to pay annually. If you want a free alternative that also works very well, you can do a pre-recorded class and upload it on Dropbox , YouTube , Vimeo and then just share the link to who subscribes for the Lead Magnet.
Now, with this Lead Magnet you must follow up to not allow it to be work in vain. I give you an example of a process that you can follow:

Capture subscribers with a list of tools: Recommend tools that have served you. This is one of the easiest Lead Magnets to create because it is basically a list. If your list is good and complete it is great because your subscribers will thank you very much. You can even add affiliate links!
For example, let's say you're going to promote a course on Instagram marketing; You make a list of tools to succeed on Instagram.

Well-known Amy Poterfield gives you a list of tools in exchange for subscribing to her list:

Capture subscribers with an Audios: You can send audios. I have seen that this works very well for people who do meditations, for example. You can upload your audios to Soundcloud (as private) and then share the link to whom you subscribe.
Following the example of meditations. Let's say you are going to do a meditation, yoga or spirituality course. Well, you do a free series of meditations like your Lead.

Check out this example of Marie Forleo's Audio course:

 Capture subscribers with a free consultation: Your Lead Magnet can be a free consultation with you, which, if you know how to take it well, can be a way to get new customers;). To schedule your free consultations I recommend you take a look at the service of
Calendly is a platform that allows people to schedule an appointment with you super fast. Basically, you tell Calendly what time you have free for appointments (you can also synchronize Calendly with your Google calendar and other calendars) and share your calendar so that people can schedule their appointment automatically. After scheduling your appointment, Calendly basically gives you a ‚Äúvirtual office‚Äù where you can have a video conference with the person with whom you have scheduled your appointment.

I see two disadvantages to this free consultation system. The first disadvantage is that there may be people who don't show up for the appointment, which will waste your time. I recommend that you send several e-mails to confirm the appointment and that you ask very directly to the person who has scheduled an appointment with you that respects your time.

The disadvantage in terms of the Calendly system is that not everyone understands how to enter the system, I recommend that you explain them super clearly.

 

 Capture subscribers with a Workbook: This is another Lead Magnet super easy to make and that people find it super useful. To create a worksheet, I recommend you do it in a writable pdf. Use pdfescape . com to create your pdf in which people can write without printing the document.
 

 Capture subscribers with a Free Resource Library: This is the Lead Magnet system that I use. I create a specific Lead Magnet for almost every one of my blog articles and together in a library of free resources to which my subscribers have access. Here I tell you exactly how to create a free resource library step by step and for free.
This is one of the Lead Magnets that I use to attract subscribers:

 Capture subscribers with Quizes: It's a great way to win subscribers. Basically you give them the option to take a "Quiz" and to receive the results they must subscribe. The disadvantage is that I have not found free options to create quizes. The platform that I have tried to create quizes and that I use is Thrive.
Look at the example of Tony Robbins, he is using a Quiz:

 Capture subscribers with   video courses: I have also tried this and it has been very good for me. My free courses are on the Teachable platform and you can see them here.
I think the advantage of the courses is that you give your subscribers something of great value and that you will gain a lot of value.

 

Capture subscribers with Discounts or Bonuses: Discount for your product is a simple way to generate sales and increase your database.
 

Capture subscribers with  Templates: The templates have worked very well for me as Lead Magnet. My templates are in writable pdf format, made with pdfescape.com. For giving you examples of my templates; Template to create a marketing plan or template to create a business plan. All these templates are in the Free Resources section of my blog to which my subscribers have access.
 

Capture subscribers with Check-lists: They are super easy to do in a writable pdf (with pfdespace.com). I have for example a checklist to beat the Facebook algorithm or a checklist to make a perfect post. All my checklists are available in my free resource library.
 

Capture subscribers with Reports: Reports are an incredible way to give valuable information to your audience. The disadvantage that I see is that it can take a little more time and money to be done.
example lead magnet report
 Capture subscribers with Ebooks: Contrary to what many people think, creating an E-book can be very easy. I would suggest using one of the templates found in Canva to create your E-book if you have little text.
If you have a lot of text, it may be a better idea to simply write it in Word, put a cover page, index, footnotes and transform it into pdf. The only E-book that I have in my free resource library is an E-book to create viral pins.

 

 Capture subscribers with a Product  Demo: Another Lead Magnet that is usually used is a product test. For example, you could give him the first chapter of your book, the first lesson of your course, etc.
 

And that is! I hope he gave you some ideas üòÄ
