Use the Paretto principle in your favor
Paretto's principle states that 80% of all results are due to 20% of all causes and was presented by Italian economist Vilfredo Paretto in 1896.

Paretto discovered that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population and that this distribution was consistent in many other disciplines.

Paretto's principle is still popular, as many companies have discovered that 80% of their income comes from 20% of their efforts / products.

So you can use Paretto's principle for your advantage in life:

If you own a business; Determine what 20% of your offers generate 80% of your income and focus on the tasks that really give you results.
If you do not own a business, you can use the Paretto principle to increase your overall productivity; Determine what 20% of your work tasks are most important or recognized by your superiors. Focus on these tasks. Can you make them even better? Faster?
If you are a seller, determine what 20% of customers contribute 80% of your income and make sure you keep these customers satisfied.

2.    Use the Parkingson Law in your favor
Parkingson's law says that a task takes the time assigned to it. In other words; If you assign 2 months to write a proposal, you will use 2 months.
On the contrary, if you assign 2 weeks, it will take you 2 weeks. Super productive people like Shaan Patel, who is a boy of little more than 20 years old who currently studies medicine, manages his million-dollar company (founded by himself), runs marathons and writes books that are among the best sellers say that Use this technique to increase your productivity. 

Shaan Patel confesses that he assigned 2 weeks to write his successful book "Self made Success" because that was all the time he had and wanted to achieve his dream. Is Patel a super human? I doubt it. He says his secret is that he works intelligently - and very hard. He says he uses the Parkingson Law to make sure he achieves the best results in the shortest possible time. 

3. Listen to podcasts
Most of us have little time left, so if you want to increase your knowledge without having to read, start listening to podcasts to learn about topics you want to know. Podcasts are audio files available on the Internet that can be downloaded and listened to whenever you want.

It's like getting a radio station to completely focus on the topics you want to hear! I listen to many podcasts about social media marketing and the amount of knowledge I have gained in this way is impressive. 

But podcasts are not just for knowledge topics, you can also use them for entertainment and to listen to people who inspire you. Like YouTube videos, there are many podcasts that cover each topic, but vary in terms of quality,


4.     Prepare an action plan
To reach your goals, you need to take action and it is much easier to take action if you have an action plan ready. An action plan basically consists of setting your goals and making a list of a set of tasks that will lead you to achieve each goal. When you have your list of tasks ready, set a deadline to meet them.


5. Just do it!
There was a time when I worked in marketing for a wine company. The work involved traveling a lot to different fairs, events and meetings with clients. I was in Oslo, Madrid and Moscow in the same week. Sometimes I used to feel overwhelmed and tired before the trips began. Then I realized that events and trips come and then go, as easy as that. Don't get tired before the task begins. Take a minute now to realize the many things you have accomplished in life (a thesis, a great presentation, give birth, etc.) and realize that things are done one step at a time. that you feel overwhelmed, recover the memory of all the tasks that you have already done, this will help you understand that the tasks come and go and that they are not worth stressing for them before they arrive.
