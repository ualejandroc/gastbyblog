The beginnings for all entrepreneurs are very complicated but sometimes the lack of planning and confusion also influence what our first steps should be to achieve the objectives of our personal brand . My beginnings were also difficult and many times I was tempted to throw in the towel. But thanks to this experience, I can now help you to start your online business.
The secret is that it is not only about launching yourself with great enthusiasm but about doing it consciously, with your feet on the ground . We must know the limitations of our business, the market situation and our real chances of success or failure. We can have an excellent idea but in the market there are thousands of ideas from great entrepreneurs who believe they can succeed.
In my experience as a Mentoring for professionals who want to be leaders in their sector, I find many who are very clear about their project, but do not know how to get more visibility for their online business . This confusing situation often leads to blockage and lack of illusion. Thanks to my advice, they manage to create a strategy to differentiate themselves from the competition and stand out in a highly saturated market.

## Undertake: an unpaved road

Thanks to my first efforts to launch my personal brand and my experience as a mentoring of professionals, I know first hand the difficulties that entrepreneurs face. There are no quick and magical formulas. To launch and position your personal brand is to travel an unpaved dirt road, in which many weeds will grow . Therefore, we must try to overcome all difficulties and seek help if at any time we feel lost.
I am going to give you some practical advice for desperate entrepreneurs. You already know that if you need my help you can sign up for my practical programs that you can find on my website, in which I will guide you step by step. I will love to help you successfully launch your online business. For now do not miss some basic tips:
## 1. Be clear about the purpose of the online business
Starting an online business should not only aim to sell a product, a course or a service. You have to create an idealistic project that helps you establish lasting relationships with customers and the market . We cannot launch a project with a tour only for the present. How long do you want it to last? One month, six months, one year ... It makes no sense. We must think about a project with a future and with real possibilities.
## 2. Differentiate yourself in the market
What can you offer as a personal brand that does not exist in the market? Why do customers buy your products? If you want to succeed you must differentiate yourself from other brands . If you offer the same as others, even at a cheaper price, sales will never take off. Find what differentiates you, that only you offer and focus your web and communication strategy on your strengths. Do not forget also to assess your weaknesses and be aware of what they may imply for our project.
## 3. All sum
Not only do you have to create a website, social networks or a communication plan, but everyone has to add to be the seed of your online project. They must row in the same direction and together they have to ensure that your business has the maximum visibility possible . Your personal brand must be present in all the steps of your project from the web design to the newsletters. You must optimize your communication to the maximum to be considered an authority in the sector. You also have to optimize your web strategy to sell more every day. If sales stagnate, try to find out what is failing and try to solve it as soon as possible.

## 4. Create a community
Your personal brand must have its own community that follows you, loves you and feels the need to buy your products, services or courses. It is not enough that they enter your website by chance thanks to advertising and gossip for your pages. It is essential that you connect with your audience to the point that they look for you and enter your website and social networks . That is why you must pay time and attention to your social networks and optimize your profiles on Facebook , Linkedin, Twitter, Pinterest or Instagram. You can also create a list of subscribers and send them timely news, irresistible offers or surveys.
## 5. Never settle
The entrepreneurial spirit implies constant improvement. Do not stay alone with small successes . Maybe you have managed to sell some products or courses but you should not settle. You have to become a priority for your customers. Try to improve every day, expand and update your training with specific courses and seek the advice of the best professionals.
Do you dare to hope again with your project? You will only get it to take off if you have very clear your goals and possibilities. Be realistic and ask for help if you find yourself locked . All entrepreneurs go through difficult times.
