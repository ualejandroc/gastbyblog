Every day a lot of blogs and online businesses are created. Unfortunately, many of them will not generate income and will be abandoned for lack of time or convicted because "it did not work." To ensure that blog generates intake, first of all CREATE A BUSINESS PLAN. This is the basis for a successful blog!

I really think that an online business is one of the most likely to give results, because after all, on the internet you have the world at your fingertips.

In addition, the cost of starting a blog or online business is minimal compared to other businesses.

So, if you plan correctly you have huge chances of success.

## 1. Finance
The financial aspect was originally at the end of this article, but when I reviewed it, I decided to put it in the lead because I am sure that it is the most important part of a business and tragically it is also the one that many entrepreneurs put aside. Incredibly, many people start a business because it seems like a good idea, without studying how feasible the business is.

Now, do not be scared with the term Finance, you will see how easy it is to be able to handle them if you follow this guide that I give you.

STEP 1: Define your startup budget and monthly costs. Online businesses generally have a very small startup investment. For example, in the case of a blog, with about 200usd you already have to launch it. The important investment at the beginning of your blog is the time you spend without receiving income.

STEP 2. Sales Objectives and Forecasts: 
Do not panic with the term "sales forecast" because it is really something we can all do. If your business already has an open time, the sales forecast would be based on past sales history.

However, if your business is new, you will have to gather information that will help you "forecast" your income. Some factors that will help you make the decision:

Are there competitors in the market? (That there is good news because it means there is a market)
How much do other competitors sell?
What percentage of your competitors' sales could you monopolize?
What is market size? (i.e. how many people could theoretically buy your product
Many times, new businesses make a sales forecast that is too ambitious or too ambitious. To counter this trend, you can make 3 forecasts:
· Ambitious

· Moderate

· Low

This will allow you to have a clearer vision of what can happen in reality.

 

 

## 2. Mission and vision
When I was studying at the university, I thought that this mission, vision and values ​​were pure blah blah blah. Over the years I have realized the importance of defining them when setting up a blog or online business.

These elements are not to be taken lightly and are worth analyzing before starting as they are a compass that will direct the path of your business. These are the elements that will communicate to your readers, customers, and future employees, the reason why you exist and how you do things.

Mission: in a few sentences describe the reason why the business exists, its objectives and philosophies.

The Mission does not need to be altruistic, but I firmly believe that businesses that have a positive reason for being work better. Below are some examples of Missions:

The Life is Good Company, which sells T-shirts with phrases describes its mission as "Spreading the power of optimisim". The phrases are very funny and give anyone a smile just by reading them.
The company Honest Tea's mission is to create and promote organic, healthy and good-tasting drinks ”“
The Facebook Mission (rewritten in 2017) is “Give people the power to build communities and bring the world closer”
 


 

Eye! If you are interested, I also have a free workshop to make your marketing plan for your venture with me. If you dare, you can access for free HERE.
Vision: In the vision define your long-term objectives. Writing objectives is a proven way to make it much more possible to achieve them.

## 3. Description of your business
What does your blog / business do

This may seem elementary, but writing it gives clarity. For example, my blog is dedicated to providing information about blogging, online business and social media to Spanish-speaking entrepreneurs.

If you need help to define the topic on which to write, you can read this guide How to choose topic for my blog.

What makes your business different from the rest?

To answer this question you must first analyze the competition. It may be that you have been studying your idea for a while or that your blog / business is already established and surely you already know who your competitors are. Make a list of who they are for each of them, analyze the following points:

 

Their strategies and objectives: what strategies are they using to publicize and sell their products? What channels are they on? (Facebook, linkedin, Pinterest, twitter, Instagram, virtual or face-to-face conferences)

Your products: make   a list of your products and their price range.

Analyze their strengths and weaknesses: Think about what they are good at and not so much. Write down how you could use this information to develop your business strategy.

 

After analyzing your competition, let them do their job and do yours. You already know what is in the market and you have been able to analyze how you are going to enter with your proposal. Do not become obsessed with competitors because finally in the world of blogging your most powerful weapon is your uniqueness and the unique way in which you as a human being connect with other human beings.

Also, surely these other businesses have more time than you in the market and it is not going to be fair to compare yourself with them (if you are just starting).

 

Remember that the question to answer after analyzing your competition is; What makes your blog / business different from the rest? Be sure to answer.

 

In the free resources sections you will find worksheets to help you with your business plan. 

 

## 4.Analyze your niche
If your blog already has an open time, surely you will already have an audience in the case of a blog or customers in the case of a business. In this case one of the best strategies is to listen to your customers / audience. Thanks to social networks we can be communicated with our readers and know what they need.

 

Another alternative is to do a survey among your readers asking them everything you want to know (keep in mind that people are super busy and will not want to answer very long surveys, so make it as short as possible)

 

Another alternative is to get into Facebook groups where your audience can meet. To find this type of group you must do a group search on Facebook by keywords.

If there are no Facebook groups on the topic that interests you, you have another option; create one! For example, I wanted to connect with Spanish-speaking bloggers but I couldn't find this type of group on Facebook so I believed a lot. If you are interested in joining other bloggers here is the ink of the group.

 

Your audience / customers are the basis of your business, listen to them!
· Read your comments

· Generate surveys

· Use Facebook groups to capture your audience

 

Now, if you have not started your blog yet, you can also decide for yourself who you are going to write for. Defining your audience instead of writing for "anyone" is an important advantage, so I advise you to plan it.  In this article I talk about how to define your audience , but basically it is this:

-Start by making a list of the people you know who you would like to have as readers.

- Make a list of the general characteristics of these people, age, gender, income level

-Make a list of those people's interests. What sports do they practice, what kind of food do they eat, what hobbies do they have?

These elements will give you an idea of ​​who you write for. When you write keep the mental image of those people you have on your list.

Now, a super important point; Remember that I said write the income level of your audience. If your blog has as one of its objectives to generate income, it is important to take the income level of your audience. For example, if your audience is a very young group, it will be difficult for them to have the purchasing power you want, in this case you should perhaps try to pass your message to their parents.

## 5. Promotion strategy
Like any company, your blog or online business should be known and it is important to have a clear strategy of how to do it from the beginning.

I recommend that you focus your strategy on Social Media (Social Media) and your subscriber / client list.



Social media

Social media are incredibly useful tools to publicize your blog or business to the world. Social media is so many and can generate so much activity that it is a good idea to choose which ones to focus on. That is, it is not necessary to be in all media all the time, choose 2 on which you will focus your strategy.

I personally have seen good results with Facebook and Pinterest, but this depends on your type of business.

It is important to note that patience is key. It may take a long time for your readers to have the necessary confidence in you to bet on buying some of your products (especially if they are coaching or courses).

Social media will also create a kind of "friendship" between you and your audience.

List of subscribers / customers:

Having a database of your readers through a list of subscribers is a very smart way to approach them. The subscriber list is installed from different platforms, such as mailchimp. Here I show how to manage a list of subscribers with mailchimp for free.

 

To make the subscription list effective ask yourself the following questions:

What incentive will I give my subscribers to sign up?
How often will I communicate with my subscribers?
What kind of information will I send in my subscription list?
 

Here I can underline that for online businesses (which are not blogs) for example a shoe store, children's party planner, etc. The subscriber list is equivalent to the customer list. Many entrepreneurs forget the customers they already have in the business and are dedicated to trying to get new customers, without taking into account the great potential that existing customers have.

As an entrepreneur, do not forget to maintain the relationship with your existing customers

## 6. Define how to earn money from your blog
In this space I will refer only to blogs. There are some ways to make money with your blog and having defined forms of income will help you work strategically instead of being "kicking everywhere."

In this article I talk in depth about the ways to make money with a blog, but here I list them:

With ads on your page
Selling your products either physical or virtual
Selling your services
With affiliate links
Writing paid articles
If, for example, you think that you will only be dedicated to generating money through advertisements and links on your page, you will need a huge traffic to generate money, then your strategy should focus on generating traffic.

Now, count how much traffic, subscribers, followers you will need to generate the money you want and see if your goals are realistic. If they are not, adapt your strategy.

If you want to know what the differences are between blogs that make money and those that don't, read this article.

## 7. Define your visual strategy
Think about what you want your brand to emanate visually, what colors you will use, what typeface, what kind of photos.

If you want it to be much easier for readers to remember and identify you, it is important that you use the same visual identity in the different channels you use. It is very easy to get lost and start using all kinds of colors, typography, photos, etc.

I personally use Canva (canva.com) to create the visual elements that I use in my blog, on Facebook, Pinterest and even instagram.

The subscription to Canva costs approximately 12usd per month and they give you a trial month so that you have the option to try their services. Canva's service is basically that of a very easy-to-use design software (much easier than Photoshop, for example) and also provides graphics, photographs, fonts.

One of the things I love about Canva is that it allows you to change the size of your designs depending on where you are going to use it, that is, with a click you can have a design with sizes for Pinterest, Facebook, twitter, Instagram!
