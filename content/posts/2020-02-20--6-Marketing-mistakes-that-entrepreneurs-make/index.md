Marketing Error # 1: Not having a strategy
Marketing, although sometimes associated with "sales tricks" is nothing but the way of linking the needs of people with products or services that meet those needs.

## Marketing Error # 1: Not having a strategy
This header lists because it is the error of errors and this leads to other errors. I have seen many small entrepreneurs who start a business with enthusiasm; They have their offer of products or services and their systems in order and they think they will worry about their marketing and sales strategy at some point. ..

They end up doing an activity here and another there. They spend time and money on activities from which they do not take full advantage due to lack of planning. If you do not already have your marketing plan go to the free resources section and download the template that I have there, it will help you a lot!

Not having a marketing plan is a big mistake that I want to avoid, so I created a workshop  for you to create your marketing plan with me. You can access  HERE.

For example, a company that participates in a fair related to its branch. Buy the stand, spend on the partition, have people interested in your stand. And when the fair ends… everything ends, they never collected the data of the interested parties to follow up.

Another example? The businesses that launch a campaign on Facebook, receive many visits to their page and then nothing ... They did not take more than increase their traffic during the time of the promotion and those potential clients left, perhaps not to return.

 

MARKETING, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH "SALES TRICKS" IS NOTHING BUT THE WAY OF LINKING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT MEET THOSE NEEDS.
 

The good news is that making your marketing plan is not difficult and it is even fun! It is an activity that will save you time and money in the long run, I promise you!

 

## Marketing Error # 2: A bad website or worse, not having a website!
For those who do not know me, I am passionate about guiding small entrepreneurs and bloggers on how to create marketing strategies with little budget, little work and great results and a good website gives you just that! You do it once and then it will be there making you earn money, customers, followers, IF YOU DO IT WELL!

Although it seems incredible, there are still businesses that do not have a website. According to the SCORE organization, 50% of small businesses in the United States do not have a website. Serious mistake! Taking into account that 98% percent of consumers search online to find products or services.

If you don't have a website, it's time to do it!

Now we go to businesses that have a bad website ! Here is a list of the common mistakes I've seen on web pages:

 - Lack of easily accessible contact information on the page
 - Lack of a strategy to collect data from potential clients visiting the page.
 - Unattractive design
 - Lack of “call to action” buttons
 - Lack of buttons to share on social media
 - Lack of complete information on products and services (including good photos!)
 - Bad pictures
 - Slide-show on your home page (that is proven to dislike visitors to the page)
 - The website is not designed for traffic from phones or tablets
 - Lack of SEO strategy (Search Engine Optimization)
 - A page that loads very slowly (although some factors in this aspect are out of your control, there are things you can do or avoid to make your page load fast)
 - They have not installed Google Analytics
 - There are no updates to the page with commercial information for example if you won an award, attended an important fair, went out in the press ...

And what about the Facebook page? Although it is not mandatory, I definitely recommend having a Facebook page as many consumers conduct their searches directly on Facebook. There are other advantages such as the ease of connecting with customers (with Messenger), the ease of updating, or the need to have a page to create campaigns on Facebook.

EYE! If you have a good website, but you don't have traffic, I invite you to my free online training to show you how I get THOUSANDS of visits to my site with little work. You can access the training HERE.

## Marketing Error # 3: Neglect Existing Customers
Many times the strategy and efforts are aimed at winning customers and that is very good, but please do not make the mistake of forgetting your existing customers.

Winning new customers is much more expensive than generating more sales with your existing customers so I recommend that you think about your existing customers. Can you sell them something else? Do you communicate with them often? Do you keep the communication open?

The simple formula to maintain the relationship with your existing customers is to maintain a list of customers and plan periodic communication with them through newsletters that provide something. Eye! That giving information and promotions of yours is a way of contributing J

## Marketing Error # 4: Not understanding how sales processes work
The thing does NOT work like this:

Step 1: 
The client arrives on your page (which is not optimized for search engines)

Step 2: 
the customer looks at your products or services and purchases them.

No no no. It is not at all like that. Sales are a process that goes something like this:

## Marketing Error # 5: Lack of social media strategy
This is another typical flaw, because the entrepreneur or the entrepreneur knows the importance of social media but for lack of knowledge makes posts and activities a little here, a little there. Without structure, without continuity and inefficient.

Did you know that with just one or two hours A MONTH you can plan and automate all your posts for your social media. Best of all, if you plan everything once a month, you will have the possibility to realize what kind of content you are publishing.

If you want to know how I do to organize ALL my posts in 2 hours a month, go to this article.

I also have a free and downloadable social media posts calendar that you can find in the free resources section or by clicking here.



 

## Marketing Error # 6: Lack of evaluation of the marketing activities carried out
Evaluating your activities once a month or after completing them is key to making things better the next time you do it. Put the results of your evaluation in writing. How was the activity, what should be improved, would you recommend doing it again?

Remember that if your company grows these written assessments will be very useful for people who come to work for you.

Some tips for you to have the right tools for your evaluations:

- Web page: install Google analytics and take into account by which channels your audience reaches you. What are the main landing pages. What sequence of pages people use to be on your page. What are the demographic data of your audience. What is the average time spent on the page.

- If you put advertising in certain media such as brochures, magazines or newspapers, you can include a discount coupon, so when a customer comes with that coupon you will know what publication it comes from and you will stop spending on advertising in places that may not suit you.

- If you go to fairs or events; Make a written evaluation where you summarize the participation and your recommendations.
