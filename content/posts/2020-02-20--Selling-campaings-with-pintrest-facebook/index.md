How do sales funnels work on the internet?
On the internet, sales processes DO NOT work like this:

Step 1:  The client arrives on your page (which is not optimized for search engines)

Step 2:  the customer looks at your products or services and purchases them.

No, there is usually a process in which they know you, evaluate you and finally buy you. This process has an average duration of 6 months (although there are ways to shorten it, a topic that I cannot come across in this article)

One of the best strategies to get to know you is to create content; in the form of articles on your blog.

Once they have reached your blog, it is very clever to invite them to subscribe to your list. In order to encourage them to subscribe to your list, what is called a “Lead Magnet” is used, which is a “gift” that you give your prospect to subscribe.

Once he has subscribed you have a door to contact him and in the future try to sell him.

But what about that GREAT mass of people who visited your page and did NOT subscribe?

Those are the people we will deal with VERY cleverly in this post.

How do I capture people who DO NOT subscribe to my list?
Look, I'll give it to you in steps and with examples:

STEP 1: Install the Facebook Pixel. I will talk in more detail about the Facebook Pixel later, but in summary; I tell you that it is a code that Facebook gives you which records which Facebook users are visiting your website.

You can program your pixel to record several events on your website. You can tell him to register who in another to specific pages such as certain items, sales pages, landign pages, purchase pages, etc.

Ad professionals on Facebook use Pixel (among other things) to create re-targeting campaigns. That is, we can show advertising to people who have already abandoned the shopping cart or to people who saw certain content on your page.

"People who have already entered your page are the most susceptible to buy you, direct them to your advertising"

EYE! It is important that you install the Facebook Pixel as soon as possible since the data of your users will ONLY be registered after you install the Pixel. To make good campaigns you need to have a good number of data in your Pixel.

STEP 2. You create content specially designed to capture the interest of the public that you are going to want to sell a product or service to.

For example, let's say your product is an online course on cooking for diabetics. You make articles on this subject. “5 dessert recipes suitable for diabetics” or “Diabetes is no longer a problem with these diet tips”

STEP 3 . You make pins for your articles that will go on Pinterest and take advantage of the massive traffic that comes from Pinterest. You may be interested in this article “How to make viral pins ” and I also have a free E-Book to make viral pins in the free resources section (you must subscribe to my list to pass the password)

Step 4: Create a “personalized audience on Facebook”. The personalized audience is one of the most cool elements of Facebook Ads. It is a functionality that allows you to create a specific group to whom the future can direct your ads.

For example; You can make a personalized audience with:

All the people who entered your website.
People who went ONLY to your diabetes articles
People who saw the sale page of your diabetic cooking course.
Step 5: Create specific ads for your personalized audience. Following the example of the sale of a cooking course for diabetics. You go and create an ad designed specifically for people who entered your articles that deal with diabetes.

Do you see the magic? Now you are doing directing your ads to people who are interested in the topic of the kitchen of diabetics and who ALSO already knows you because it has already gone through your page. Your chances of winning are huge!

How do I install the Facebook Pixel?
To install the Facebook Pixel you have to have a Facebook business page.

Luckily, Facebook has made it easy for me and it already has an article where it describes in detail how to install the Pixel, you can see it here.

How to paste the Pixel code into WordPress.org
I tell you the method that I used to “paste” my Pixel code on my WordPress.org site.

Step 1. I have installed the “Insert Headers and Footers” plugin and activated it.

Step 2. I have gone to my “settings” and from there I have accessed my “Header and Footer”

Step 3. I go to my "header" session and paste the code.
