## Step 1: Analysis of your ideal client
When creating your Marketing and Communication plan, it is essential that you know who your ideal client is and that way you will know what kind of person you are directing your marketing and communication efforts.

Even if you think you have it in your mind, the exercise of writing information is incredibly clarifying and useful.

When your business grows, it will be useful information for your employees and for agencies that you hire to manage your marketing. It includes demographic information, such as age, income level, education. You can also include information on how much you spend on products similar to yours, on which social media platforms spend more time. What types of media they consume.

##  Step 2: Products / Services
Once you know who your ideal customer is, you can create products and services designed to meet your client's needs.

When you started your business, you probably had an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour products and services, but now, with the information you have about your ideal client, you can refine your product to make it even more attractive to your client, or even create alternative or value-added products .

I give you an example; Let's say you have a business that offers yoga and meditation classes online and discover that your ideal client is women with school-age children. Well then, you decide to offer a mini online meditation course for children by purchasing the subscription to your other services.

Another example, let's say you have a restaurant and you see that your ideal client are executives in the area, because you create a menu for executives.

When you design your products and services, ask yourself; What does my product do? Why is it unique? What benefits does it lend?

You will see how all the elements come together as puzzle pieces until you get to an effective marketing and communication plan that generates sales.

##  Step 3: Positioning your brand
If you have reached this step you are on the right track! You already know who your ideal customer is and you have designed products and / or services that meet your needs.

Now comes the next task, how to make your brand enter the mind of the ideal customer and under what message.

Since this is a marketing and communication plan for beginners, I will tell you shortly what positioning is. Positioning is the idea with which your product or service will occupy a space in the mind of the consumer. In other words, it's how you want your ideal client to know you.


For example, www.gaia.com  is a platform where you can access documentaries, series, interviews, yoga courses, meditation courses. The content of the platform is on topics of spirituality, alternative medicine, mentality, esotericism. They are described as "like nettflix, but for spirituality," meaning they are like nettflix but for spirituality. Gaia is very clear about its target audience (ideal client), offers services for this audience and has a clear positioning message.

##  Step 4: Design of Marketing and Communication campaigns
Now that you have passed step 3 you are on the right track to creating a really professional marketing and communication plan.

In this step you are dedicated to creating campaigns and activities that promote your services products, aimed at your ideal client and with a clear positioning message (how do you want them to remember you). You see how they were all pieces of puzzle that come together!

To start putting together your campaign and activity plan, start by listing what tools you can use. I assure you that there are more channels of communication with your customers than you can imagine.

Here are some of the marketing and communication tools you can use, but there are so many that it is impossible to list them all!
Presentation of budgets: they can include discount coupons, memorabilia, and of course your contact information.

Invoices: likewise, they can include discount coupons in the next purchase or you can ask on the invoice to ask them to visit your website to download a coupon or gift.

Business cards: They are marketing elements that are not taken enough advantage, typical and they give you a common and current business card, like all of them and you end up throwing it away. There are many possibilities to make them not a paper that someone throws away. They can include a QR code or SKU that will take you to your website, or your photo, or fun or curious facts about your company or brand.

Website: Take care that you're taken out in juice! Go to this article to read about the most common mistakes when making a website.

Newsletter: You have a database of your clients or potential clients. (If you don't start it as soon as possible!). Communicate with your existing or potential customers through a newsletter or newsletter. There are many entrepreneurs who are afraid to use the newsletter for fear of looking like people ‚Äúwho want to sell or promote themselves‚Äù‚Ä¶ Well, if you are afraid it is time for you to accept that YES, you want to sell! You have a blog or business and want to sell and promote yourself. There is nothing wrong with this, the truth is that many customers will surely thank you.


E-mails: The emails are different from the newsletter since with them I refer to the e-mails that you send as part of your work to your suppliers, customers, etc. Under your signature you can put your contact information, links to social networks, website or even information about fairs in which you are going to participate or links to recently published articles.


Fairs / events : For many small and medium businesses they are key to expand and meet potential customers. They are also a fundamental element of networking for bloggers. They can be expensive, but fortunately there are many government grants for entrepreneurs. For example, I got grants from the European Union for the company where I worked and with that I financed fairs in Russia, Germany and Sweden
Ads in publications: Think of printed or digital publications where it would be great to put your advertising.

Blog (own or company): A blog is basically what is called by content marketing and is a way for your customers to find you and create a close relationship with them. If you wonder how to create a blog, in this article I tell you how to create a blog step by step with WordPress.org.
If you have your own or your company's blog, it is important that you make an editorial calendar. Although making an editorial calendar may seem like a boring task and that only generates extra work, I promise you that in the long run it will save you time and take you to take actions in a planned way. In this article I explain how to create an editorial calendar.


Appearances in the media : Appearing in a media outlet as a guest is free advertising. In addition, it is advertising that does not appear as advertising and that is why it is much more effective. If you have the possibility of appearing in a media outlet, do it and if the opportunity has not been presented, look for it!
Now, for each item on this list, brainstorming how you could use that item to promote your business. If there are tools that I have not listed and that can help you, write them down too!

## Step 5: Social Networks
It is very difficult to be in all social networks, so think about your ideal client. On what social networks do you spend more time? Focus on those networks.

Also think about what you want to communicate on social networks, think about how you want to position yourself.

Use social networks to approach your client with posts with inspirational or funny phrases and also to announce promotions, events, new posts on your blog, fairs where you will be.

To get a perfect mix of content that brings you closer to your ideal client and content that promotes your blog and business, it is most appropriate to make a plan of contents in a calendar.

TIP !, in this article I show you how to plan, program and automate the content of your social networks using only 1 or 2 hours a month!



## Step 6: Calendar of activities
Now you have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat activities you want to do. Write down all your plans on a calendar. It includes here promotions for seasons such as Christmas, Valentine's Day, Black Friday, Halloween, etc.

List everything you want to do ideally and rank the activities in order of importance. You can use colors for classification. I use the colors of the week; red for the most important activities, yellow for the moderately important ones and green for those that are not so important, but what would you like to do.

This calendar will be incredibly useful to know what you should be doing in terms of marketing and communication week by week.

## Step 7: Budget
Now the time has come to budget your activities. This is basically an estimate of how much you will have to spend on each activity.

You can make three budgets; one with the activities in red, yellow and green. Another with only the red and yellow (and leave the green in case there is more budget or things change) and another with only the red (and leave the yellow and green in case there is more budget or things change)

And ready! With all these steps you already have a strategic marketing plan and that you can easily follow thanks to your calendar. You also have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour budget.
