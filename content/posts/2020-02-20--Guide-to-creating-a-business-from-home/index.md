This article was created for two types of people:
- The one who has discovered the most simple and fundamental truth; Time is the most important and finite treasure we have.
- The one who wants to learn, how to build wealth, success and a legacy, using the power of outsourcing or “Outsourcing”.



 
We often think that to build a successful business, we need to work harder and longer than everyone else. With that “ all or nothing ” mentality , in every unexpected turn that comes along the way, we completely immerse ourselves in the problems facing our business.

You invest more and more time, more money and more effort, until you solve the problems or challenges that arise and we believe that only in this way can we succeed and achieve our goals.
 
- Who knows more about my business than me? 
- Why should I trust and pay someone else money when I know how to do it myself? 

These are questions that probably you, being a business owner, are asking yourself right now. The answer is very simple friend.
There is always someone better, more skilled, smarter, more efficient and capable than you.

Ouch! I know…
The mistake we often make as entrepreneurs (and that is the cause of many ideas and failed companies) is actually a very easy one to solve, but it requires a slight change of perspective. 

This article talks about a work system that was responsible for the creation of dynasties, empires and structures that still challenge the intelligence of experts today.

This system is called: Outsourcing.
 
- What is outsourcing? 

 
The outsourcing or outsourcing has been around for a long time, but now has become a model increasingly popular in business. It provides entrepreneurs and business founders the opportunity to delegate operations and responsibility tasks to a third party in exchange for money. 
 
- The History of Outsourcing
 
For thousands of years we have been a species that to survive, we learned the art of cooperation. 
Working together for mutual benefit has been the engine behind the innovations that have driven the world into the modern era and outsourcing was one of the tools that were used to create those innovations. 

The beginnings of outsourcing date back to the 50s and 60s when corporations discovered that additional agility and gains could be obtained by focusing on central strengths and delegating operations, tasks and responsibilities to third parties. 

In the 1970s and 1980s, what was later called outsourcing began . In 1989, the Kodak company announced “The outsourcing of most of its information technology systems”. 
This began a financial revolution in corporations that changed the modern world.

A modern example in the use of labor in China for the creation and assembly of American products. The low cost of this model has generated billions of dollars and created the financial legacy of thousands of successful companies worldwide.
 
- The Method: Delegate More, Live Better
 
The Method: Delegate More, Live Better is the method we create to build a successful business and earn more than $ 10,000 in the first 3 months and doing everything from home. 

The method is very simple and consists of 2 key points:
Delegate More - Create an operational system for the company, using virtual resources that carry out most of the tasks. 

Live Better - Learn to create the balance between being a perfectionist and obsessive, to live a healthier life and earn more money.
Our goal is to learn to separate the emotions that limit your mentality and the growth of your business. The key to scaling your business is in your ability to make decisions without the interference of your emotions. 

For many, their business is "their baby" and they are emotionally tied to that mentality. Many times because of the years of effort invested to start the business, the idea of ​​delegating responsibility to someone else is somewhat crazy. 

If this is you, I want you to meditate on this idea, you must understand that your time is limited in this life. Over the years, having worked a lifetime but having missed the most essential and important moments in the end will only cause pain and regret. 
Our system started with our businesses, we were still in our regular jobs and we had several clients doing freelancing of content creation and management of social networks.

For a long time we had the desire to start creating the Genera Más Live Better platform, but we didn't have much time, so we decided to exchange money for time and we did it as follows:
 
- We create the business concept 
- We decide the type of brand image
- We determine the needs and the cost 
- We are looking for freelancers to create our brand
 
Delegating the task of creating the brand, using freelancing services was the key to accelerating the transition from quitting to work from home. We started generating enough money to continue investing in our business and this transformed our lives. 
Here I will show you exactly how we managed to do this with screenshots and clear and precise examples. 
 
- The Absolute Guide to Creating an Online Business Using Outsourcing 
 
To start we need an example business so we will use one of our businesses as an example. The business is called Live Better Home Management and it is about property management and short-term rental services.

I will take you through the entire process so you can use it as a guide to start your own profitable business. 
We need a brand image, something that inspires confidence and professionalism. I have several ideas regarding design and I guess I can try, but mine is not graphic design.

No problem, there is someone who will make a high quality design for a very low price, but the question is; Where will we find it?
My favorite place to find freelancers is Fiverr, this place has really been fundamental for the growth of our brand and we use it constantly to delegate tasks of our business, which we don't want to do.

This allows us to have the time to continue innovating, continue learning and creating new ways to continue growing and expanding the business. 

Before, my focus was on doing everything, graphic designs, copying, web pages, offers, calls, emails, voiceovers, video editing, photography, films, etc.

But I discovered that if I continued to invest my time in these tasks, I could never scale my business the way I wanted.

That's why I started delegating those tasks to people better trained than me. This allowed me to grow my business and earn money from home. 
To start go to www.fiverr.com and proceed to register and create your account.

 
Once you create your account, you will have access to the services offered by the platform where you can:
    • Search Services
    • Filter results
    • Communicate with Freelancers
    • Many other functions

 
For my Live Better Home Management business, I need a logo to create the brand image. This will provide a level of professionalism and seriousness that I will need to gain the trust of the owners and property managers. 

 
One of the most important secrets when outsourcing is the cost of the service. If you're just starting your business, you do not have even enough money to hire the most expensive freelancers, which is why the most important key to success in Fiverr is:

- Pay the least amount of money, for the best job. 
One of Fiverr's most important tools is that it allows you to search for freelancers from around the world and find freelancers from places where service rates are cheaper. Paying less for more will increase your profit margin when your service or product enters the market and that is why it is important to reduce the cost of manufacturing but be careful , NEVER SACRIFY THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.

It is important to note that in Fiverr everyone can do business and set the prices they want and it is not that you are “taking advantage” of them and their work. It is a fair and easy exchange of goods. The freelancer determines what he wants to charge and you pay it. 
Many times what we do when we get someone great in what they do is pay more and provide more opportunities. They are more than grateful for the money and we have a hard time doing so, in addition to purchasing a quality product.

If you have the opportunity, look for a place in the world where your money goes further and create a relationship with these freelancers and if you like their work, pay them generously. 
 
Here we can see in "Seller Details" information related to the freelancer, to find a freelancer from a specific country, click where it says "( In my case ) " +96 more " and this will allow you to see the costs for the same type of work in different parts of the world. 
 
 
Once you select the country, you will see a screen like this, where you can choose the freelancer of your choice.
There are multiple filters that you can use to specify what you want. This time I am looking for a graphic designer who can make a minimalist logo. I click on the " Minimalist " box inside " Logo Style ".
 
 
 
 
- When selecting minimalist, the platform presents me with multiple offers within that category.
 
 

 
Most freelancers offer several packages, with different prices. Choose the one you want and press continue .
 

 
Once the payment for the service is completed, you will get to the following screen:
 


Then you proceed to complete the order by accepting the final delivery of the task and Voila! You have your new professional logo to start creating your business for only $ 10.
 
 

 
                               Outcome
