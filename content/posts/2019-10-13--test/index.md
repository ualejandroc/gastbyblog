Our world is  increasingly shaped by technology we use each  
and every day, it can make ours lives easier, provide anjoiment, entertainment or vast amounts  of information.
Over the years there have been a few key devices that would 
pave the way for things  to come.
Sometimes it is pretty interesting to take  a look back 
at the precursors to our modern mobile way of life,
## 1
let's start with something from way back number 10 but 
their portable game system is called the game boy  and 
unlike  olkder handheld games they are not limited to 
one single game, the Nintendo Game boy from 1989 if you
are  over the age of 21 there is a pretty high chance
that you would have enjoyed.
A feast Nicci games on the original Game boy or its 
younger brother, the game boy Color for a while there were 
all rage and it seemed that addictive simple games and 
portability with a perfect combination for the day for those
of you that are not enough to really grasp what a portable
device from nintendo really meant.
Here is a small news report from 91, let's just say that video games that had the Nintendo brand were huge video games industry is hotter than ever.
This season and one good reasons Nintendo was introduced from
hotland toys but have things gone a bit too far so it has 
come to this therapy sessions for families whom you could call 
Nintendo or saw the peer pressure.
Start like you maybe exploit it psychologists offices migth
get more crowded this holiday season at 200, a Super Nintendo 
setup cost twice as much as the old system and you con not
mix and match.
Some parents are refusing to be taken in.
I am going to say no and I am going to explain to him how
people market things to make you spend more money but no 
matter how you play the game or which game you play things. 
Definitely have come a long way since pac-man number 
9 the texas Instruments SR 10 from 1973, it was a time when
computers were nowhere to be found in the classroom there
was all slide rules and physical forms of counting then came
the texas Instruments Sr 10 it really revolutionized the 
education system for the maths and the Sciences anyway 
for 150 dollars you can calculate all the reciprocals square
roots and slide rule functions you wanted, I wanted it
would have been a nerds paradise but it would have made
things a whole lot easier though number 8.
The first Walkman by Sony in 1979 that was portable music
not a radio but real portable music, any song you wanted in
