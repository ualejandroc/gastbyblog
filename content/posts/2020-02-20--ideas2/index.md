What are the advantages of making money from home?
Apart from the ones I already mentioned, there is a very important one: Savings.
When you have a job to do at home, you save:

    • Eating at home
    • Dress clothes
    • Laundry / dry cleaning
    • Gasoline and car maintenance
    • Makeup
    • Nursery / babysitter
    
Ask yourself this question: With these savings, how much money do you need to earn from home to be able to maintain your lifestyle?
Therefore, here are some options to make money from home that you can start NOW to fulfill your dreams as soon as possible.
  
## 1. Virtual assistant

In English "VA", a virtual assistant is like a secretary of our time, but now online, independent and flexible schedule.
VAs do tasks from entering data to an excel, managing social networks or making reservations.  Everything that the person who hired you needs.  And online!
You can start by looking at the main job  boards  or at    freelancer.es    or  Workana.
  

Offline work
Look for options to earn money from home in companies with flexible schedules, there are two options:
  
## 2. Find a job with flexible hours
Think about what skills you have and what kind of jobs you could do.

According to them, contact companies that have flexible or part-time schedules.
For example: Works by commission on sales, insurance sales, cars, homes, consultants, web developer, programmer, designer, event coordination, customer service, etc.
As for companies: SC Johnson, General Electric, Amazon, Google, etc.
According to  InfoEmpleo  , 96% of the best companies allow flexible schedules or telework.
  
## 3. Earn money from home through the skills you have
What knowledge do you have?

Photography, accounting, dancing, English, do you know how to cook, walk dogs, take care of children, cut grass, math, run errands or have a car and could you use it as a taxi for your acquaintances?
I bet there is more than one in your community that needs your services and you don't really need much investment.  Activate your "financial creativity" as mentioned again by Robert Kiyosaki.

## 4. Marketing for small businesses
I love this idea.  If you know how to create Facebook Ads that work and manage social networks, you should start looking for small businesses around you to sell your services.
A good pitch (service sales speech) includes the current state of your web presence and how you can improve it and generate many sales.
  
## 5. Design websites
If you know how to make 0 web pages and you have good design bases, you can do the same as in point 2 but concentrate on their web pages.
Find who has web pages in poor condition and pitch them with your proposals.
  
## 6. Private classes
If you know English, you can give private lessons to Chinese children through  VIPKID  , I have heard very good reviews of this page.
You can also teach math, science or any other subject in  SuperProf.mx,    start advertising through Facebook Marketplace and in Facebook sales groups or through your neighbors.
  
## 7. Airbnb income
But I don't have so many rooms!  Surely you are thinking.
The good thing is good, I mean that you rent yours (although it is a good way to start), if not you dedicate yourself to offer other people's rooms.
It includes answering messages and questions from potential tenants and, perhaps, even managing them physically (cleaning the house, washing the bedding, making sure there is shampoo, soap, etc.).
  
## 8. Editor
With the amount of blogs there are now, it is increasingly difficult to create  good content  to attract more people.
The basic thing is to have great writing and spelling and complement it with knowledge of SEO and image design.  Try to specialize in a topic, to make it easier for you to get customers.
  
## 9. Multilevel / Catalog
Definition
First, what is a multilevel company?  Also known as multilevel marketing (MLM) and network marketing:
“Businesses formed by a network of independent sellers or distributors that generate income: 1. Direct sale of products (supplied by the company that owns the business) 2. Sales made by sellers or distributors that integrate their affiliate networks.”
That is, you sell and earn money;  you put people and you earn with your sales.  That easy.
What is the difference with a pyramid?  Also known as Ponzi Scheme:
Pyramid businesses (which are banned) are where you  can  only  make money by getting more people.  That is, you earn more money by getting people than selling the products (because there is no market or the market is saturated).
Advantage
The first hook is that the "personal finance guru", Robert Kiyosaki, recommends it.
But beware, it is not true:
Recommend that you enter for:
    • Train you in sales:    Because they usually have a proven team for you to learn to sell.
    • Generate emotional intelligence:    which you will need if you want to have your business.
I was in one of these companies and the truth is that the training in both sales and personal growth is very strong because you are with a team that supports and motivates you, apart from that you want to achieve objectives within the company.
Could you get that knowledge out?
Yes!  You can read books and see conferences, but what I take with me is the group of people motivating you and following the same path (it's almost like a sect, almost, because I've never been in one).
The second is that you can earn money from home and you are free to organize, which is totally true, but if you want to earn "good" you need time and effort.  A lot of time and a lot of effort.  Never believe in “get rich quickly with only 3 hours a week”.  It is never true.
Disadvantages
    • Very few people make money in these companies (some mention that 95 to 99% do not, but I could not corroborate the source).
    • You have to invest money to be able to buy the membership or become a stock.  Prices range from 200 to even 20,000.
    • You do not "start a business" you are actually a commission seller who tries to generate a personal brand, but is still a company seller.
conclusion
If you want to be part of this:
    • Find a company that you love:  There are thousands of companies that sell from telecommunications to investments;  from makeup to household items.  Find a product that you love to make it easier for you to recommend it.  Also check the compensation plan.
    • Market:  If there are too many associates in an area, it is very likely that the market is already saturated.
    • Upline:  The person who is inviting you must be someone with experience, knowledge and admire, so you can learn from it.
    • Define a maximum amount to invest:  And consider it lost.  Define what your limit is going to be because from Herbalife in the movie “Betting to Zero” (found on Netflix) to LuLaRoe (MLM that sells leggings) they have been sued by former partners who were told if they wanted to succeed in this business, they had to invest more and more, even at the expense of their vehicle, borrowing and even causing anxiety problems.
    • Talk to the people inside:    With the person who wants to put you in: How much you earn from your network and how much of the product sales.  Also with new and old partners, to also check that the earnings are constant.
I already leave it to your decision.
If you want to know more about multilevel companies, I wrote a complete article on how to choose one and how to decide whether to enter or not.
  
## 10. Coach
This profession is growing a lot and why not, if it is very good to have someone who is continually pushing you towards your goals.
There are business, personal improvement, life, health, etc. coaches.  Any topic that interests you can be ideal to start a business.
  
Undertake online

## 11. Freelancer
First, what is a freelancer?
According to Wikipedia:
"Activity carried out by the person who works independently or is dedicated to perform work autonomously that allows him to perform in his profession or in those areas that may be more lucrative and are aimed at third parties that require specific services"
I think it's the worst definition I've read!  Conclusion: Person who works independently and does temporary projects or jobs.
New: What skills do you have for which there are people who would like to pay you?
Some options: Virtual assistant, graphic designer, actress or voice actress.
There are some pages where you can offer your services, one of the most famous is  Fiverr    and  Freelancer  (in English) and even if you put in the “freelance” job exchanges there are also jobs.  Check  this  Entrepreneur  post  with the best sites to find freelance jobs.
I put it here because although you have to look for jobs, you do not receive a fixed salary and you have to pay the benefits of a job, such as Infonavit or IMSS, but the advantage is that you can earn money from home.
  
Online Business
It is no secret that online businesses are becoming very popular to earn money from home.  And rightly so, they have had the highest growth in recent years.
There are many ways based on which you can be part of the online world:
  

## 12. Generate content - Blogger
I love this option (so much that I already put it into practice) because the possibilities of growth and profits are exponential.  Just don't think he gives you money immediately.
You are starting your own business, your own brand that definitely gives you all the power to grow a little or a lot.
You can start earning money from home by generating content through a blog, youtube, intagram, pinterest, etc.
Then it can be capitalized by:
    • Advertising
    • Affiliate Marketing
    • Own products
    • Affiliates of third party products
    • Marketing for sponsored companies / post
I do not recommend this option if you want to make money quickly, but you can start working at your own pace and write about what you are passionate about.
If you decide to choose this path, keep in mind that you have to invest a minimum in hosting, domain and I recommend that you pay a course to learn to blog (if you take this seriously).
If you are very interested in opening your blog, I highly recommend my 9 steps to open a successful blog (to keep you).
  

## 13. Create a Virtual Store
A very good option to earn money from home is to start a virtual store.  You have different options:
    • If you create a product  , you can sell it online.  There are different media depending on what kind of product it is, but most should be able to have a place on  Etsy  .  Crafts, designs, etc. are marketed in this place.  
    • If you want to sell someone else's products  , I recommend that you keep a blog at the same time so that through the interactions that are achieved, you can generate more confidence so that they buy you.  It is called dropshipping when you advertise a product online but you never touch it (you don't even have it physically in existence).  The manufacturer is responsible for shipping it and sending it directly to the customer in your name.
    • If you are a nutritionist, psychologist, network expert or any service professional, I would recommend that you start by generating content in order to position yourself as an expert in the subject and thus be able to sell your products, courses or services.
Here I leave 25 specific ideas to make money from home online.
